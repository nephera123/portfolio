                Transferring credit is hard. Jargon is everywhere, complex rules and conditions apply, and students
                often report feeling confused and helpless. LikelyThis is here to provide simple peace-of-mind. Is your
                course Likely or Unlikely to transfer?

                Founder of LikelyThis, Brian Bacon, is a higher education professional with 15+ years of experience,
                especially in the world of "transfer." LikelyThis is based upon extensive transfer research combined
                with collegiate experience. Those looking to transfer however should follow this advice: don't do this
                in isolation. Course transferability is most likely successful when students connect early and often
                with their guidance counselors, advisors, and admissions representatives.
